### Warning!
In case you are familiar with the word "inception", the following concept can be highly addictive.

### What if ...
1.  ... a framework & all the apps you build would run inside a separate thread (web worker)?
2.  ... the main thread would be mostly idle, only applying the real dom manipulations,
so there were no background tasks slowing it down?
3.  ... a framework was fully build on top of ES8, but could run inside multiple workers without any Javascript builds?
4.  ... you would not even need source-maps to debug your code, since you do get the real code 1:1?
5.  ... you would never again have to use string based pseudo XML templates?
6.  ... you would never again have to use any sort of templates at all?
7.  ... you could use persistent JSON structures instead which can be changed the same and any way you like to
throughout the component lifecycle?
8.  ... there was a custom virtual dom engine in place which is so fast that it can change your mind about 
the performance of user interfaces?
9.  ... the ES8 class system was enhanced with a custom config system, making it easier to extend and work with config
driven design patterns?
10.  ... your user interfaces could truly scale?

### Impossible? Pick with caution!
