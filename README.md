### Warning!
This is a new a paradigm. If you want to enter a new era of making better Web Based User Interfaces,
the following concepts will be addictive.

### What if ...
1.  ... a framework & all the apps you build would run inside a separate thread (web worker)?<br/>
→ **Performance**
2.  ... the main thread would be mostly idle, only applying the real dom manipulations,
so there were no background tasks slowing it down?<br/>
⇒ **Extreme UI responsiveness**
3.  ... a framework was fully build on top of ES8, but could run inside multiple workers without any Javascript builds?<br/>
➠ **Faster Development**
4.  ... you would not even need source-maps to debug your code, since you do get the real code 1:1?<br/>
➠ **Smoother Debugging Experience**
5.  ... you would never again have to use string based pseudo XML templates?<br/>
➠ **Simplicity, no more scoping nightmares**
6.  ... you would never again have to use any sort of templates at all?<br/>
➠ **You are in control**
7.  ... you could use persistent JSON structures instead which can be changed the same and any way you like to
throughout the component lifecycle?<br/>
➠ **Simplicity**
8.  ... there was a custom virtual dom engine in place which is so fast that it can change your mind about 
the performance of user interfaces?<br/>
➠ **Extreme performance**
9.  ... the ES8 class system was enhanced with a custom config system, making it easier to extend and work with config
driven design patterns?<br/>
➠ **Extensibility**
10.  ... your user interfaces could truly scale?<br/>
➠ **Extreme Performance**
