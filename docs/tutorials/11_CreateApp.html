    <p>Inside the package.json you will find the script "create-app", which is a very good starting point for creating
    your first neo.mjs app. You can run it inside the root folder of the neo.mjs repository like this:</p>
    <pre><code>npm run create-app</code></pre>
    <p>We would like to shed some light on the internals of this process to show you how to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an app using the script</li>
        <li>Change the name of your app</li>
        <li>Change the theme(s) of your app</li>
        <li>Create an app manually</li>
        <li>Remove an app you no longer need</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>1)</b> After running the script, you will get asked to enter the name of your app (defaults to MyApp)</p>
    <img src="./resources/images/tutorials/create-app-choose-name.png">
    <p>Afterwards you will get asked if you want to use the neo-theme-dark, neo-theme-light or both:</p>
    <img src="./resources/images/tutorials/create-app-choose-theme.png">
    <p>This is pretty much it. You will see a new folder under neo/apps with the lowercase version of your app name.<br/>
    Hint: We recommend to stick to alphabetic characters for your app name.</p>
    <img src="./resources/images/tutorials/create-app-files.png">
    <p>You can see the code of the script in <a href="https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/buildScripts/createApp.js">neo/buildScripts/createApp.js</a></p>
    <p>The script will check, if neo/buildScripts/webpack/development/json/myApps.json exists.<br/>
    The same will happen for neo/buildScripts/webpack/production/ (sticking to dev from here on, it is 1:1 for prod)</p>
    <p>In case the file does not exist, neo/buildScripts/webpack/development/json/myApps.template.json will get consumed to generate it.</p>
