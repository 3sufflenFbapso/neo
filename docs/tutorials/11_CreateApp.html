    <p>Inside the package.json you will find the script "create-app", which is a very good starting point for creating
    your first neo.mjs app. You can run it inside the root folder of the neo.mjs repository like this:</p>
    `npm run create-app`
    <p>We would like to shed some light on the internals of this process to show you how:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an app using the script</li>
        <li>Create an app manually</li>
        <li>Remove an app you no longer need</li>
    </ol>
