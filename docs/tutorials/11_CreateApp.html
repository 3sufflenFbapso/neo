    <p>Inside the package.json you will find the script "create-app", which is a very good starting point for creating
    your first neo.mjs app. You can run it inside the root folder of the neo.mjs repository like this:</p>
    <pre><code>npm run create-app</code></pre>
    <p>We would like to shed some light on the internals of this process to show you how:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an app using the script</li>
        <li>Change the name of your app</li>
        <li>Change the theme(s) of your app</li>
        <li>Create an app manually</li>
        <li>Remove an app you no longer need</li>
    </ol>
    <p>1) After running the script, you will get asked to enter the name of your app (defaults to MyApp)</p>

    <p>Afterwards you will get asked if you want to use the theme-dark, theme-light or both:</p>

    <p>This is pretty much it. You will see a new folder under neo/apps with the lowercase version of your app name.
    Hint: We recommend to stick to alphabetic characters for your app name.</p>
