One of the main features of D16 Group PunchBOX v1.0.1 WiN OSX is its four-module architecture, which allows you to layer and blend different sound sources to create your own custom bass drum sounds. You can choose from four types of modules: Kick, Click, Tops, and Tools. Each module has its own set of parameters and options, such as envelopes, filters, pitch, distortion, and more.
 
The Kick module is the main sound source of PunchBOX, and it offers four different synthesis modes: Sine, 909, 808, and D16. The Sine mode is a simple sine wave generator with a pitch envelope and a harmonic shaper. The 909 mode emulates the classic Roland TR-909 kick drum circuit, with a tuneable oscillator and a decay envelope. The 808 mode simulates the legendary Roland TR-808 kick drum sound, with a tone and a decay knob. The D16 mode is a hybrid of the 909 and 808 modes, with a variable waveform and a pitch envelope.
 
The Click module adds a short and sharp transient to the kick sound, which can help it cut through the mix. You can choose from over 800 samples of various clicks, claps, snares, hats, and other percussive sounds. You can also adjust the volume, pan, pitch, filter, and envelope of the click sound.
 
The Tops module adds some high-frequency content to the kick sound, such as noise, hiss, or cymbals. You can select from over 900 samples of different tops sounds, and tweak their volume, pan, pitch, filter, and envelope. You can also use the Tops module to create layered kicks or pseudo-sidechain effects.
 
The Tools module is a special sound source that can be used to enhance or modify the kick sound in various ways. You can choose from three types of tools: Bit Crusher, Noise Generator, and FM Synthesizer. The Bit Crusher reduces the bit depth and sample rate of the kick sound, creating digital artifacts and distortion. The Noise Generator adds white noise to the kick sound, which can be useful for creating vinyl-like effects or filling up the spectrum. The FM Synthesizer is a simple two-operator FM synth that can generate metallic or harmonic sounds that can be mixed with the kick sound.
